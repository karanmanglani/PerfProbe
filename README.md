# PerfProbe - Distributed Performance & Stress Analyzer
Project Objective:
Design and implement a modular performance analysis framework that can:
1. Generate load against APIs or services (HTTP endpoints)
2. Collect metrics like latency, throughput, error rates
3. Visualize results (CLI + Web Dashboard)
4. Support scalable concurrent testing using async/multithreading
